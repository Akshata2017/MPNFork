CURRENT GUIDE FOR EXECUTION, CHANGED LATER I PROMISE.
At the root directory, "./run install" to download the dependencies locally (the blablalba intentionally doesn't exist for testing purposes), ./run environment/sampleurlfile.txt  (case insensitive woohoo) to run my cliClass which will print the list of urls after STORING THEM in the CLIObject.
